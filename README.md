# Happy Birthday email sender app

This application will automatically send a birthday congratulations mail to members of the Database
and notifications to all the rest of the members.

## Getting started

To get started with the app, clone the repo and then install the needed gems:


    $bundle install --without production

Next migrate the database:


    $rails db:migrate


Finally, run the test suite to verify that everything is working correctly:


    $rails test


If the test suite passes, you'll be ready to run the app in a local server:


    $rails server
